Patterns of tree growth

<h1>Segments</h1>
Trees are made of branch segments and other stuff. Each segment comes from buds on previous segments. This means that segments will have more segments on them. The location of the buds depend on branching patterns.
Almost all trees have only one branching pattern.

<h1>Branch pattern</h1>
There is different branching patterns.

<h2>Alternating</h2>
Alternating branching rotates by an angle close to 180 degrees, for each bud. Example: level 1 left, level 2 right, level 3 left level 4 right.

<h2>Rotating alternating</h2>
Rotating alternating is like the alternating branching pattern, but every 2 buds, it rotates an additional amount that is close to 90 degrees. Example: level 1 north, level 2 south, level 3 east, level 4 west, level 5 north, level 6 south.
This seems to be the most common branching pattern.
Trees with this include cherry.

<h2>Opposite</h2>
Opposite branching have branches on opposite sides. Buds are rotated the same way on the same branch segment except for the ones at the end. Example: level 1 left & right, level 2 left & right, level 3 left & right.
Rose has this branching pattern.

<h2>Rotating opposite</h2>
Rotating opposite is like opposite branching pattern, but every 2 buds, it rotates an additional amount that is close to 90 degrees.

<h1>Imperfection</h1>
Branches and buds can fall off a tree.
Buds can also not grow the next year and get delayed for multiple years. This causes trees to not look perfect and causes different sized branches.
Because each branch segment does not point in the same direction, branches can look like a helix or zig-zag.

<h1>Leaf</h1>
At the end of alternating branch, there is one bud in the same direction as the branch.
At the end of opposite branching branch, there is two buds facing away from each other.
Buds and leaves grow together in same place and follow the same pattern.

<h1>Flower</h1>
Flowers go at end of branch segment for certain trees, or at the side. They replace leaves and buds.
The flower branches have same branching pattern and fall off after a while.
