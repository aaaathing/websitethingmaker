thingmaker: I miss the age when minekhan was great from 2021 to 2023. It was so great and fun and exciting and interconnected and cool. There were posts and people on the website and they could actually be changed by other people! In minekhan, there was multiplayer and survival mode and physics and a lot of people and more. I spent a few hours every day adding new features or blocks.
Will it ever be like this again? sadly, that greatness is hard to achieve, because it would be hard to get so many people to come.

<h3>Beginning of thingmaker's website</h3>
<time>December 2020</time>
<b>thingmaker:</b>
I created a website around late 2020 in the desktop folder of my computer.
At this time, it was not accessible from internet.
The home page and nav bar were copied from w3schools, and the home page showed your programs and webpages.
There was a code editor where you could make programs and webpages, which was inspired by KA.

Some time before December 2020, i downloaded a version of MineKhan (0.7.1) probably from https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/minekhan/5647155001376768.
At this time, I used "Text" to edit code.
The first thing added was tnt block, which was already in the code, so i simply uncommented it.
Then portal blocks and obsidian were added, which probably did not do anything yet.
The portal blocks textures copied from another spin-off.
<img src="/assets/images/portal thing December 18 2020 7.15 PM copy.jpg" loading="lazy">
<details>
Once, I made a world called "ChristmasPresent". Me and probably B. built a giant present out of red and green concrete. It had red string on the side and red knot on top. There was a stair from the ground to a hole on the present. Inside, i probably put gold and diamonds blocks.
Later, i opened the world and saw that it was black where the stairs touched the other blocks.
</details>

On Janurary 16 2021, I tried making a server by installing "wamp server". I did not know much about hosting websites and I could not make it work.

Later i tried adding redstone, by adding on and off redstone dust blocks.
I changed things like adding onupdate to updateBlock.
The redstone blocks didn't work well because it caused errors often, but it stayed.
<details>One time, i was testing the redstone dust, which looked like a cube. In a world with normal world type, I put a few of them together and put a redstone block, and they turned on. Then i did it with around 5 redstone dust, but the console showed an error like "maximum call stack size exceeded".</details>
Later, i also added a block called 'buffer' was added which was supposed to behave like a redstone repeater.
Then textures and new blocks called 'soup' were added to it.
At these times, i often searched for new MineKhan spin-offs to copy things from.
Some of the things copied from the spin-offs were fall damage and island world type and biomes (desert and field).
<time>April 2021</time>
Starting near April 2021, i checked the profile of RedMonster (https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/monsterred/projects) frequently for new things to add to the version of MineKhan.
Some of those things were flowers, doors, lanterns, cactus.
<details>One time, i was adding flowers to minekhan. I searched something like "minecraft flowers" and clicked Images. I found a image showing many different flowers on a gray background. I downloaded it, then searched for images of each of the flowers. I used "texture to 16 by 16.html" to resize them.</details>
Some time later, cows and pigs were added which move in random directions and looked bad.
After April 10 2021, i found multiplayer minekhan on willard.fun.
<details>
I was probably excited about multiplayer. One time around noon, i made a world called "my city". I built a glowstone stair next to a tree into the sky and some paths. I clicked "Open world to public" and left the computer. Later, i came back and it said "connection lost".
Some days later, i moved the world to another computer by copying save code. I made it multiplayer again and built many things like tunnels, houses, underground houses, elevators. Other people built messages. Later, i saw someone that i thought was griefing. I opened devtools and typed "ban('???')". They were still there so i tried typing it again.
Another time, i made some commands for minekhan in a file called "minekhan commands.js". I added things like fromPlayer and fillToPlayer and blockTxt and copyToPlayer and pasteAtPlayer. I made a big building using the commands. Later, i copied the building into "my city".
</details>
Some time later, i downloaded a newer version of MineKhan from some time before <a href="https://github.com/Willard21/MineKhan/tree/dc6f22381138c4e01799ec107bfb02e2bdc5033c">this</a>.
<details>
One time, i created a world on the newer version and did some things. Probably watching was B.. Later i went in a cave and while looking towards the entrance, pressed backspace to drop a few items. I probably thought that it was amazing. I paused it and opened Options and dragged the FOV slider back and forth. Whenever the slider was dragged, the items spinned.
</details>
I copied and pasted my changes to the newer version and probably deleted the older version.

<time>May 2021</time>
On May 8 2021, the version of MineKhan with changes by thingmaker was uploaded to replit.
A few days later, on May 12 2021, the website was also moved onto replit (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/www) and became accessible from the internet.
The website was still very basic.
Then, i wanted to add a login to the website, which was also probably inspired by KA.
So it was added and you could change your username and the username showed on the nav bar.
On May 24 2021, a server (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/server) was made for the website.
A simple login were added to the website and server.
The code for the login was copied from somewhere else because i did not know how to make a login at that time.
Websockets were also experimented with because they would allow adding multiplayer to thingmaker's version of MineKhan.
In May 2021, multiplayer was added to the version of MineKhan.
On May 26, posts and comments on posts was added to the server and website.
Posts were a part of the website where people could post text.
Then, the first post not by me appeared. (name: Hello, by: Spider, content: Hello)
New users near this time: Spider, sup6666, MyHat3, Pillow1007

<time>June 2021</time>
On June 1 2021, profile pictures were added to the website and server.
Notifications were also added and a way to ban in MineKhan was added to the server.
Live comments were also added to posts.
<details>
From 10 AM to 10:40, I decided to change the look of some parts of the website because they looked bad. I searched for "login layout" and clicked images and copied some of layouts.
From 2:30 PM to 5:00, I changed the account page by searching for "account layout". I added profile picture and backgrounds and change password.
</details>
A few sounds including grass sound and stone sound were added to the version of MineKhan.
On June 10, RedMonster added many more sounds to a fork (https://replit.com/@RedMonster12/minekhan-update) of the version of MineKhan.
<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 9.39.24 AM.jpg" loading="lazy">
This was also when nether terrain was updated in the version of MineKhan.

In July 2021, RedMonster12 began suggesting blocks to add to MineKhan and uploaded many textures.
After sideways torches were added to thingmaker's version of MineKhan, it was updated to 1.0.3.

<time>September 2021</time>
<details>One day, Aussie Audra was hosting a survival world. It was using the default seed (which most worlds did), and there was snow at the spawn. I was probably surprised because Aussie Audra usually stayed on willard.fun. I might have built a house in the snowy area in the world. Later, i was in a cave near the snowy area, and probably had an iron pickaxe, then the server probably closed. After rejoining, the inventory was reset to empty. I thought that it was annoying, so I decided to make inventory save in multiplayer. Afterwards, I probably did not see Aussie Audra on this version of MineKhan again.</details>

Panoramas were added to the version of MineKhan and it was updated to 1.0.4.
<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/p.png">image</a>
At this time, i made a post about maps for halloween.
The scarecrow was used for the panorama.
Sometime around October 6, grass color in minekhan was changed to very green color.

<time>November 2021</time>
The player model in the version of MineKhan was updated and changing skins was added.
Between November 17 and November 23, a filter for the chat was added to the version of MineKhan.
At this time, it only filtered two words: f___ and st____

<time>December 2021</time>
Near December 2021, TNJS (https://replit.com/@tnjs) invited me to help make a website.
The idea was to create a website where people could upload MineKhan maps to share and download them.
It was likely that someone told him to ask me to help create the website for MineKhan maps.
So, the website for MineKhan was created by thingmaker and TNJS.
The first things added were a way to upload maps.
A few weeks later, push notifications were added.
Anyone who subscribed would get a notification when a new map was uploaded.

In Janurary 2022, an update for redstone had started.
After a few days, the server also started to run out of space for users and posts.

<time>Feburary 2022</time>
On Feburary 17, they were moved to a different place. (replit db to level db)
At this time, on Feburary 18, the version of MineKhan was getting very popular and there were many worlds in multiplayer at the same time, so a limit of 5 worlds at the same time was added.
New users: repeat

<time>March 2022</time>
In March 2022, there was an idea to create a wiki for MineKhan on the website for MineKhan.
So the wiki for MineKhan was created, and it looked really bad.

<h3>Exciting age starts</h3>
<time>April 2022</time>
On April 1, 2022, the redstone update for the version of MineKhan was released and it was updated to 1.0.5.
<details>On April 1, before I released the new update, whem i was going home, i was excited (probably more excited than any time before) because i was going to release the new update which was bigger than previous updates. When i got home, i copied and pasted the new version to replit, and it was released. Then, i opened a world containing a redstone calculator and made a panorama, then i changed the background to that. Then i thought that since it was April 1, i should put a rickroll. I added it as a menu music. Then i saw that all the multiplayer worlds were still on the previous version.</details>
<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/redstone_april-2022.png">image</a>
On April 14, 2022, i started to create the first external server for the version of MineKhan, which was called 'Test server'. (https://replit.com/@MineKhan/mkServer)
External servers were a way to host a world for the version of MineKhan where the world stayed open almost all the time and the world could be controlled with code.
At first, this external server did not have a world, instead, when joining, it asked for a suggestion for the name.
Then, on April 18, a world save code was added, and on April 19, portals (teleports to another room) were added.
The code for external servers was still bad and it was easy to cheat. (flying, getting any item)

<time>May 2022</time>
On May 3 2022, whitelist was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
Capes and cloud saves for MineKhan were also added.
<details><summary>mysterious hacks</summary>A user who's username was yiff, and also had a previous username that probably contained 'piano' in it, probably appeared on May 5. This user used something that was called 'karmaclient', which was like a bot, to run commands in the version of MineKhan like '.troll username' or '.crash'. Most of the time when he joined, something like these would show: "yiff joined. yiff joined. yiff: [ADMIN] K4RMACLIENT ACTIVATED.". I was in a survival world with normal world type hosted by someone, and he joined with his previous username which contained "piano". He used a command (probably ".kill") when i was in the entrance of a cave, but it did not work because of a bug. Later, I was in a world called "Galdor's castle 2" which had a castle, then he joined with the username that started with a y, and used the command ".crash". A message appeared that said "CR4SH" and it froze. Another time, I was in a superflat world in multiplayer, then he joined but did not turn on the client that had the commands. I used a command like "/sendeval yiff Messages.write('.troll yiff')", then he said something like "you try to use sendeval on me". Unfortunately, this user disappeared after a few days and i did not find other information.</details>

<time>June 2022</time>
Unfortunately, the popularity decreased a lot in the summer, but multiplayer worlds in the version of MineKhan was still common.
In June 2022, multiplayer in the version of MineKhan stopped working.
The server for the website for MineKhan ran out of space, which happened faster than normal, and stopped working.
This caused multiplayer to stop working.
At this time, i was away for about a week and did not know about it, and some people thought he couldn't fix it.
There was a post called 'Admin vote'.
On June 19, a skybox was added to the version of MineKhan.
It was a simple gradient that was brighter in the middle.
On June 25, the code for external servers were moved. (to https://www.npmjs.com/package/minekhan-server)
On June 27, a room with creative mode was added to the Test server.
A external server called 'War SMP' was also created.
On June 28, a lobby was added, then bedwars was added, which had 4 islands and a wait for 4 players and a win when a bed was broken. It was not very good quality because there was flat layer of grass underneath.
New users: ILikeCheese
New users near this time: Speedy4, springyeet

<time>July 2022</time>
In July 2022, there were many accounts on the server that were unused, so many of these were deleted.
On July 6, a external server called 'Dope SMP' was created, and a thing that ban people when they try to ban.
On July 27, flowing water and lava was added to the version of MineKhan.
The flowing water was glitchy in multiplayer because they appeared and disappeared.
On the last day of July, the users and posts and other things were moved again. (level db to cloud storage)

<time>August 2022</time>
On August 1, an external server called "Luke's Server" was created, which had a survival anarchy and a game called 'The Pit' where players fight and get to the top of a tower.
On August 8, claiming chunks was added to the Test server.
There were more external servers: one by Paragram (forgot name), Epixel, one by RedMonster12.

During August and September, more redstone things were added to the version of MineKhan.
<details>
Near this time, someone sent a notification that looked like "New comment at New block thread&lt;/a>". It seemed like it was formatted wrong, so i looked at the unformmated one. It looked like there was XSS code for commenting the cookies in the notification. The post that it commented at was probably by sup6666. I didn't see any comments, so i thought that the XSS was harmless. Later, there probably was a comment by Luke in the post which contained the cookies.
Another time, after i came home, i joined Test Server. Then i saw that someone else had my username. The other people were probably Speedy4 and another one. The messages were like this: <blockquote>2-people: why is there 2 of me<br> 2-people: what did the other one do<br> Speedy4?: not much</blockquote> I quickly typed a command like: "/sendeval 2-people Messages.write(document.cookie)" and probably another that reloaded. Then i quickly deleted the session.
</details>
On August 23, someone (from before) found that Luke's bio said that his account was taken for <span>rans</span>om because he was helping to prevent XSS.

<time>September 2022</time>
In September 2022, TomMustBe12 started sending emails to thingmaker about making him admin or hacking the version of MineKhan.
September 2022, new users: Thunder_Wolf, perX, Express
On September 7, posts were made to load faster.
On September 20, the message was added to the server that showed if someone was a admin when they joined a world in the version of MineKhan.
On September 22, a option for disabling filter for chat was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
<img src="/assets/images/Screen Shot 2022-09-02 at 8.31.12 PM.jpg" loading="lazy">
<details>Some time before September 19, sup6666 started using the code that disabled the filter for everyone. <code inline>Messages.remove=[]</code> Some time before September 22, sup6666 started saying #saveminecraft. He also sent messages (message: "f___ 2-people") with the title command that had f words that the filter could not remove. He stopped after the option for disabling the filter was added. He probably did it because a filter was added to MC that many people disliked.<br></details>
<details>From August 31 to September 2, thingmaker made a vc for fun (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/voice-chat). It was bad quality but also had a written chat. Soon, many people started using it.</details>

<time>October 2022</time>
On October 2, comments were added to user profiles.
Later in October, i decided to combine the website and the server with the new website for MineKhan. (https://replit.com/@minekhan/MineKhan)
The maps and wiki pages were also moved to the place where the users and posts were.
The home page of thingmaker's website and the website for MineKhan were also combined, and the website was renamed.
This was also when TomMustBe12 created the form, 'Admin for MineKhan'. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19w9xtnu1rh1NEWQsQ4LErVo2DCyAbUx_I6bO2AmocgE)
<details><span style="color:red">Another thing that happened was that Spa<span>mmer17 sayed that they would make the website g</span>one if not give admin. When i saw it, it felt like a lot fear, like when everything is ending. Many things including code and important history on GH were deleted because of this.</span></details>
<details>Around this time, many people wanted admin which was probably because they saw that others were. They probably saw being admin as being better. Many people asked thingmaker for it. Most people stopped asking around Janurary 2023.</details>

<time>November 2022</time>
After some time, in November 2022, saving previous version of wiki pages was added to the website for MineKhan.
New users: rayLee
On November 27, a game mode called 'chaos' was added to the Test server. It was a game mode where lava falls from the sky.
At the end of November, external servers for MineKhan were updated to be faster by making it connect directly. (it was like that when external servers were first added)

<time>December 2022</time>
<datails><summary>Another 'hacked' client</summary>On December 4, TomMustBe12 created something like a plugin that allowed people to cheat. (https://replit.com/@awhatcott/KhaHack) It seemed that only a few people used it.</datails>

On December 7, the order of posts was finally reversed to make the most recent one on top.

<time>Janurary 2023</time>
Janurary 2023, new users: Caterpillar_fan, Light_FN, 2bHNSTi (possibly wrong time)
On Janurary 1, i thought that TomMustBe12 had stlen programs and code from him, so a message was added that explained it.
On Janurary 5, a cape was limited to certain people.
On Janurary 7, the message that showed if someone was a admin was removed.

<time>Feburary 2023</time>
<details>rayLee sayed that they would <span>take away the website and b<span>an thing</span>maker from the website if not gi</span>ven admin.</details>
On Feburary 3, features.js was added to the version of MineKhan.
It was a script that had a 1 in 1000 chance of running, that would randomly show the message 'it will be gone' and run randomly generated commands.

<time>March 2023</time>
As March 2023 began, the website was about to be moved again because the website started to stop working and replit's free hosting was going to end in 2024.
The console of the server was filled messages of socket hang up or something similar.
At this time, resource packs had also been added to the version of MineKhan.
Finally, after a month, the website was moved. (to thingmaker.us.eu.org)
TNJS did not go to the new website.

<h3>Quiet age starts</h3>
<time>April 2023</time>
After the website was moved, the website started working again and became faster.
The website was renamed back to 'My website'.
At this time, the website popularity had decreased more.
In April 2023, many things were added to the version MineKhan, including hardcore mode, double sided signs, debug stick, oil, silver, and more.
Also, i tried adding a ender dragon, and started making a classic resource pack

Multiplayer was also changed to make cheating harder.
New users: sus12
Many more months were used to improve the terrain in the version of MineKhan because i did not think it was good enough.

<time>November 2023</time>
<time>December 2023</time>

<time>March 2024</time>
In March 2024, the version of MineKhan was updated to 1.1.1, which made cheating even harder.
At this time, There were about 30 users per day. (there may have been more that were not logged in)
Soon thingmaker's version of MineKhan was discontinued, because the amount of players had decreased a lot.

<h3>Moving again</h3>
<time>July 2024</time>
On July 10, 2024, the website was moved again. (to aaaathing.github.io)
The website was now static, so the login and posts and MineKhan multiplayer could not be used.

<time>August 2024</time>
On August 11 2024, i started writing the history.
On August 21 2024, the website was moved and became not static.
Many people came back but there were still few people.

<h2>Find more things</h2>
