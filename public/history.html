I discovered MineKhan in August 2020.
On August 11, 2020, I made a webpage on KA that linked to minekhan on KA. <a href="/stuff/ka-oldacc/hello.html">Link</a>
Between September 2020 to December 2020, i probably searched for "code minecraft" many times.

<h3>Beginning of thingmaker's website</h3>
<b>thingmaker:</b>
I created a website around late 2020 in the desktop folder of my computer.
At this time, it was not accessible from internet.
The home page and nav bar were copied from w3schools, and the home page showed your programs and webpages.
There was a code editor where you could make programs and webpages, which was inspired by KA.

Some time before December 2020, i downloaded a version of MineKhan (0.7.1) probably from https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/minekhan/5647155001376768.
At this time, I used "Text" to edit code.
The first thing added was tnt block, which was already in the code, so i simply uncommented it.
Then portal blocks and obsidian were added, which probably did not do anything yet.
The portal blocks textures copied from another spin-off.
<img src="/assets/images/portal thing December 18 2020 7.15 PM copy.jpg" loading="lazy">
<details>
Once, I made a world called "ChristmasPresent". Me and probably B. built a giant present out of red and green concrete. It had red string on the side and red knot on top. There was a stair from the ground to a hole on the present. Inside, i probably put gold and diamonds blocks.
Later, i opened the world and saw that it was black where the stairs touched the other blocks.
</details>

On Janurary 16 2021, I tried making a server by installing "wamp server". I did not know much about hosting websites and I could not make it work.

Later i tried adding redstone, by adding on and off redstone dust blocks.
I changed things like adding onupdate to updateBlock.
The redstone blocks didn't work well because it caused errors often, but it stayed.
<details>One time, i was testing the redstone dust, which looked like a cube. In a world with normal world type, I put a few of them together and put a redstone block, and they turned on. Then i did it with around 5 redstone dust, but the console showed an error like "maximum call stack size exceeded".</details>
Later, i also added a block called 'buffer' was added which was supposed to behave like a redstone repeater.
Then textures and new blocks called 'soup' were added to it.
At these times, i often searched for new MineKhan spin-offs to copy things from.
Some of the things copied from the spin-offs were fall damage and island world type and biomes (desert and field).
Starting near April 2021, i checked the profile of RedMonster (https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/monsterred/projects) frequently for new things to add to the version of MineKhan.
Some of those things were flowers, doors, lanterns, cactus.
<details>One time, i was adding flowers to minekhan. I searched something like "minecraft flowers" and clicked Images. I found a image showing many different flowers on a gray background. I downloaded it, then searched for images of each of the flowers. I used "texture to 16 by 16.html" to resize them.</details>
Some time later, cows and pigs were added which move in random directions and looked bad.
After April 10 2021, i found multiplayer minekhan on willard.fun.
<details>
I was probably excited about multiplayer. One time around noon, i made a world called "my city". I built a glowstone stair next to a tree into the sky and some paths. I clicked "Open world to public" and left the computer. Later, i came back and it said "connection lost".
Some days later, i moved the world to another computer by copying save code. I made it multiplayer again and built many things like tunnels, houses, underground houses, elevators. Other people built messages. Later, i saw someone that i thought was griefing. I opened devtools and typed "ban('???')". They were still there so i tried typing it again.
Another time, i made some commands for minekhan in a file called "minekhan commands.js". I added things like fromPlayer and fillToPlayer and blockTxt and copyToPlayer and pasteAtPlayer. I made a big building using the commands. Later, i copied the building into "my city".
</details>
Some time later, i downloaded a newer version of MineKhan from some time before <a href="https://github.com/Willard21/MineKhan/tree/dc6f22381138c4e01799ec107bfb02e2bdc5033c">this</a>.
<details>
One time, i created a world on the newer version and did some things. Probably watching was B.. Later i went in a cave and while looking towards the entrance, pressed backspace to drop a few items. I probably thought that it was amazing. I paused it and opened Options and dragged the FOV slider back and forth. Whenever the slider was dragged, the items spinned.
</details>
I copied and pasted my changes to the newer version and probably deleted the older version.

<details>
On May 3, Willard put a link to the <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share/MineKhan-Minecraft-for-Khan-Academy/87382">Replit post</a>. I found it and looked at the post and maybe the comments. I found out that it was possible to host websites on replit. A few days before May 8, I made account on replit on chromebook. After a while, i decided to delete it.
On May 8, I made a account again. I did not want to use my previous username. Finally, i thought about how i make things and decided to use the username "thingMaker".
</details>
On May 8 2021, the version of MineKhan with changes by thingmaker was uploaded to replit.
A few days later, on May 12 2021, the website was also moved onto replit (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/www) and became accessible from the internet.
The website was still very basic.
Then, i wanted to add a login to the website, which was also probably inspired by KA.
So it was added and you could change your username and the username showed on the nav bar.
On May 24 2021, a server (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/server) was made for the website.
A simple login were added to the website and server.
The code for the login was copied from somewhere else because i did not know how to make a login at that time.
Websockets were also experimented with because they would allow adding multiplayer to thingmaker's version of MineKhan.
In May 2021, multiplayer was added to the version of MineKhan.
On May 26, posts and comments on posts was added to the server and website.
Posts were a part of the website where people could post text.
Then, the first post not by me appeared. (name: Hello, by: Spider, content: Hello)
<details>
One time (irl), I was at the couch and looking at the home page of my website on the ipad. I might have been showing them the website stats. I noticed that the username at the top right was "Roger999" which wasn't supposed to happen. I thought something like "who are these weird people?". But i was probably excited that there were new people on my website.
One time around this, I came home and did the usual checks. I probably found a new thing on RedMonster's ka profile. It might have been pots or cactus or lantern. I copied the textures, "consts" (block states), and other things. There was sunlight coming in through the window and going on the table. It probably felt nice (it was probably spring).
Some time near this time, I tried to add breaking blocks in survival mode to the version of MineKhan. The time for breaking grass and dirt was added, which was very fast. Then, adding crack texture was tried. At first, the block textures got messed up. After some time, the crack texture showed up almost correctly because it had z-fighting. It was left like that.
One time near this, me and B. were playing with the multiplayer drawing (multiplayer.thingmaker.repl.co). Then someone joined the multiplayer drawing. The chat looked something like this: ... me:"are you fe___" "yes". I was probably excited.
Another time near this, me and B. and F. decided to play with minekhan multiplayer. F. was far away. In minekhan, i clicked "Multiplayer" and clicked "The one and only server" and clicked "Start server" and probably changed it to superflat and clicked "Create new world". F. joined, but it was a different world type for him. So I started the server again with a new world, but when F. joined again, it was still not working correctly. I thought something like "it shouldn't happen because it sends the save code". Then i told F. to click "Singleplayer" and "Create new world" and "World type: normal" and go back and join again. The world type was correct for him. Afterwards, we did things like make a trail of blocks, probably put some glowstone.
One time on willard.fun minekhan, i joined a superflat world. There was one other person, and he was building a big building (about 50 by 50 blocks). One of the walls was incomplete. I went outside the building. Later, the other person built a vertical message on the ground out of blocks that said "HI". It was probably a little hard to read because the sky light was dark.

</details>
New users near this time: Spider, sup6666, MyHat3, Pillow1007

On June 1 2021, profile pictures were added to the website and server.
Notifications were also added and a way to ban in MineKhan was added to the server.
Live comments were also added to posts.
<details>
From 10 AM to 10:40, I decided to change the look of some parts of the website because they looked bad. I searched for "login layout" and clicked images and copied some of layouts.
From 2:30 PM to 5:00, I changed the account page by searching for "account layout". I added profile picture and backgrounds and change password.
</details>
A few sounds including grass sound and stone sound were added to the version of MineKhan.
On June 10, RedMonster added many more sounds to a fork (https://replit.com/@RedMonster12/minekhan-update) of the version of MineKhan.
<img src="/assets/images/Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 9.39.24 AM.jpg" loading="lazy">
This was also when nether terrain was updated in the version of MineKhan.
<img src="/assets/images/n.png" loading="lazy">
New users at this time: Roger999, RedMonster12, weqwef (aka Guineapigbridge and SpiderScript), Magic4792
New users near this time: Brenda_Puckle
<details>
One time, I had a world called "House" which was superflat and contained a large house made of quartz, and turned on multiplayer for it. Then, Roger999 joined and there was a very loud sound which was caused by setting many blocks, so he said something like "ow my ears". Some further details lost. Some time later, I saw that someone else had a copy of the world, with multiplayer on, and people (probably including Brenda_Puckle) were improving it, so i deleted the original one which was a mistake. In the copied world, i probably built a toilet and saw other people (probably Roger999) doing things with spruce doors.
Another time, I joined a world which was hosted by someone that was either netherBuilder or destiny6. They were building a big building like a fortess in the nether. This was when the nether had small hills but no overhangs, before it was updated. Some time after joining, i saw that they were building a floor manually (probably made of glowstone), and i wanted to help them build it faster, so i used commands (/fromPlayer /fillToPlayer).
Another time, I joined a world which was hosted by sup6666. It was normal world type and had a house in a cave with pillars, which i also might have built a toilet in, and other stuff. Then, Pillow1007 joined and i thought that he rarely join even though he was one of the first, after a few minutes, Pillow1007 left. Later, when joining again, the world type became island world type, which was a bug. The house with stairs and other people were floating above the water.
Another time, I was in a world hosted by MyHat3. He was building the walls of something big. Then, it froze. After a while, it unfroze and all the things that happened when it froze happened very quickly, including him moving around. I thought that it was probably lag.
Another time, I was hosting a world which was normal world type. Then netherBuilder joined. I might have asked why there were floating branches but no jungle trees. He probably said that it was using setBlock instead of spawnBlock. I thought that it was surprising that he knew about it. (a year later, i found similarities with netherBuilder and sup6666). I looked at the code for generating jungle trees and saw that it was using setBlock but still could not figure out why the branches were floating.
One time, I was in Brenda_Puckle's world. I built a fountain using water blocks and stairs.
One time around this, B. and F. were playing "PARKOUR MAP".
</details>

In July 2021, RedMonster12 began suggesting blocks to add to MineKhan and uploaded many textures.
After sideways torches were added to thingmaker's version of MineKhan, it was updated to 1.0.3.
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/doooij2qr/image/upload/v1626571425/1626571424328.png" loading="lazy" title="made by RedMonster12">
<details>
One time near this time, I was in a world which was probably hosted by me. It was in a sparse jungle, which had moss on the floor at the time. The others in the world were sup6666 (blue wool), RedMonster12 (black wool), and probably another person that looked like green wool. I looked like stone bricks. I switched the view to third person and said, "everyone in here is wool except me". RedMonster12 probably said "lol".
On July 4, i was adding something (probably lava rivers) to nether. In the afternoon, while i was doing it, it became the time to go to SF to see fireworks. A lot of stuff happened. After i came back, it was night.
One time, I was adding something (it seems to be ice and slime) (it happened before, probably when adding oak sapling and other saplings), and when i opened it in chrome, the screen was white and there was error in the console. Some time later, I figured out that it was because it ran out of space for block ids (it was more than 255). So i went to the "consts" (block states) and added something like "&lt;&lt;1" to each of them. I opened it again but it still had errors. I kept increasing the number and when it was 5, it worked.
One time around this, I was adding something (probably head blocks), but when i tested it, the textures were completly stretched vertically. Later, i found out that it was caused by texture atlas running out of space.

In August 2021, Luke started to add pistons to his copy of thingmaker's version of MineKhan. (https://replit.com/@LukeP0WERS/MineKhan-testing)
New users near this time: novacoding
New users at this time: Luke, multibuilder, SpaceSoldier (other usernames: SpaceSoldier248), TayyabR, Aussie Audra
<details>
One day near this time, in a world in the version of MineKhan, Luke asked me if he could help develop MineKhan. I told him that there were about 30K lines of code. He might have sayed something like "wow".
One day between July 30 and August 22, i was adding amethyst to minekhan. In a normal world, at a lower terrain, i probably placed and breaked amethyst clusters in one place many times. I also tried walking on top of them by standing on it and some solid blocks next to it. It made amethyst sounds. I thought that probably their stepping sounds sounded better than their placing sounds.
One time around this, I was in a superflat world with a few people and many builds. I built a house out of deepslate tiles. It was about 20 by 15 blocks. The wall had one layer of deepslate, it was not finished yet. I might have placed some amethyst.
One time around this, I was in a superflat world with a few people but probably few builds. I was building a deepslate house, about 10 by 15 blocks. It had 2 levels and the frame was made of spruce logs and stairs next to a wall and a hole (about 5 by 1) on the second floor for the stairs. The walls of the second level were not finished yet. I was placing some spruce logs sideways and probably thought about how they looked the same when placed in opposite directions. Later, the world probably closed and didn't open again and i was probably sad because it was lost.
One time around this, the minecraft beta playlist on c418.com was playing and it was at the disc songs. (in minekhan) I was in a superflat world with a few people and many builds. I built a small thing that had a platform above ground, slime on the ground next to it, and another platform on the other side. There were walls on the platforms, and the second platform probably had a space under it. I went on the first platform and sprinted forward, and it fell onto the slime and bounced and landed on the second platform.

September 2021:
<details>One day, Aussie Audra was hosting a survival world. It was using the default seed (which most worlds did), and there was snow at the spawn. I was probably surprised because Aussie Audra usually stayed on willard.fun. I might have built a house in the snowy area in the world. Later, i was in a cave near the snowy area, and probably had an iron pickaxe, then the server probably closed. After rejoining, the inventory was reset to empty. I thought that it was annoying, so I decided to make inventory save in multiplayer. Afterwards, I probably did not see Aussie Audra on this version of MineKhan again.</details>

In October 2021, panoramas were added to the version of MineKhan and it was updated to 1.0.4.
<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/p.png">image</a>
At this time, i made a post about maps for halloween.
The scarecrow was used for the panorama.
Sometime around October 6, grass color in minekhan was changed to very green color.

<details>
There was a multiplayer world hosted by MyHat3. It actually started before october, near July. It started as a superflat world. Later, many people joined and built things including a store, library, and other things. The world was very big. It was open for many hours. After a while, someone sayed that it was night and told people to sleep, it was probably pretend. Many other things happened but details lost. The image of the store appeared in October, when MyHat3 announced that it was back. It didn't stay open for long.
Some time around this time (may be off by a few months), i was in a world hosted by someone. It was normal world type and survival. After some time in it, i and possibly B. had made a house out of saplings which turned into trees. Then, we got iron (probably got it from another house) and might have duplicated it. Then, an iron door was put on the house made of trees. we probably put the extra iron blocks (about 3) on the front of the house.
One time, i was hosting a world called "scarecrow". Later sup6666 joined. After a while, i decided to use sendeval: "worlds.sendEval(0,1,"survival=true")". The messages were like: "sup6666: how did you do that" "sup6666: ??? i see it in the log". Later, some other people joined and i used the sendeval on them.
</details>

Then, in November 2021, the player model in the version of MineKhan was updated and changing skins was added.
Between November 17 and November 23, a filter for the chat was added to the version of MineKhan.
At this time, it only filtered two words: f___ and st____

Soon after updating the player model, i either joined RedMonster12's world or RedMonster12 joined my world. The world was normal world type and near a tree. RedMonster12 said something about the player model and repeatedly pressed the button for sneak. It looked like they were going up and down because sneaking did not change the pose yet.
One time around this, i was in superflat world hosted by someone, and sup6666 joined. I saw that he changed skin and the back side was showing because it was transparent. He didn't move for a long time.
Another time around this, sup6666 told me to change cull face on a specific line. Previously, i made the back side of semi-transparent things show.
</details>

Near December 2021, TNJS (https://replit.com/@tnjs) invited me to help make a website.
The idea was to create a website where people could upload MineKhan maps to share and download them.
It was likely that someone told him to ask me to help create the website for MineKhan maps.
So, the website for MineKhan was created by thingmaker and TNJS.
The first things added were a way to upload maps.
A few weeks later, push notifications were added.
Anyone who subscribed would get a notification when a new map was uploaded.

One time, i joined a world called 'Prison Life! Join now!'. It was survival mode and had a big bedrock building with many rooms. The first time i joined, I looked around and saw lava behind chains. Another time, I found some stripped logs and got them and made crafting table and a tool. Another time, i got out of the building and put some saplings near the building, then i made a stair out of dirt for going back in the building.
Another time near this, i was in a world hosted by someone. It was normal world type. I was doing something else. Then someone with username "Two-People" joined and started chatting with the others in the world. Later, there was a "You died" screen, and i saw the chat messages, then i tried following them, but the connection started getting slow. Someone might have started hitting. Soon, the world closed. I banned the username "Two-People".
One time around this, I was in a superflat world. SomeBoyPlayz was also there and probably more people. The message were so like this: "SomeBoyPlayz: the server was down" "2-people: i was at _ at that time" "SomeBoyPlayz: really? how _ are you" "2-people: _"
One time, i was hosting "Build a city in survival". I did other things for a while. When i went back, the screen was white. There were a few people and many chat messages. I saved it and reloaded and saw that the cactuses were huge.
One time around this, i was in a superflat world and the people were probably doing a build battle. There was 2 huge intersecting bedrock walls (about 100 wide and 50 tall). I decided to play some music, so i used a command like "/sendeval @A playMusic(game.creative[0])" I used the command a few more times later with different music.
One time around this, I was in a superflat world with 2 other people who where related. There were many buildings about 10 by 10 and 30 tall. The buildings were each made of different blocks like "soup", "randomSoup", amethyst blocks. The whole place with buildings was probably about 100 by 100 blocks wide. I probably flew around. They might have said that they were recording video.

New users near this time: Butter (other usernames: Am_Butter, Sharky), Entity_303, Mrbeast

In Janurary 2022, an update for redstone had started.
After a few days, the server also started to run out of space for users and posts.
New users: Trexler180 (other usernames: Trexler), Prytor, Kiro_sama, Zenith
On Feburary 17, they were moved to a different place. (replit db to level db)
At this time, on Feburary 18, the version of MineKhan was getting very popular and there were many worlds in multiplayer at the same time, so a limit of 5 worlds at the same time was added.
New users: repeat
<details>
One time, i joined a world hosted by Entity_303. Am_Butter was probably also in there. I probably built a house with oak logs and planks. Later, the world closed. In another world, i said something like "Entity_303, can you open your survival world". The world opened again and i joined again.
One day while watching B. do mc bedwars, i thought about redstone and how good it would be to add it to MineKhan. So i started making a redstone simulator until late at night (about 9:30 PM).
One day near Janurary 20, i was making a shape for redstone torch. I made a new superflat world and put a redstone wall torch. I moved inside the torch, which was hard because it moved too much even when i pressed a key quickly. I checked if it was aligned and it was almost aligned. So i switched to Text and thought about which numbers should be adjusted and adjusted the numbers. Then i checked if it was aligned and adjusted it a few more times. Finally, it was aligned and had no more gaps. It probably took a few hours.
After Janurary 20, I was in superflat world with a few things in it. There were other people. I opened the inventory and got the g__. I dropped a few items from above next to people, probably in spectator mode. Later, there were messages that said "??? died because he used a ___ backwards. ___s are dangerous and stuff".
</details>

In March 2022, there was an idea to create a wiki for MineKhan on the website for MineKhan.
So the wiki for MineKhan was created, and it looked really bad.

<h3>Exciting age starts</h3>
On April 1, 2022, the redstone update for the version of MineKhan was released and it was updated to 1.0.5.
<details>On April 1, before I released the new update, whem i was going home, i was excited (probably more excited than any time before) because i was going to release the new update which was bigger than previous updates. When i got home, i copied and pasted the new version to replit, and it was released. Then, i opened a world containing a redstone calculator and made a panorama, then i changed the background to that. Then i thought that since it was April 1, i should put a rickroll. I added it as a menu music. Then i saw that all the multiplayer worlds were still on the previous version.</details>
<a href="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/redstone_april-2022.png">image</a>
On April 14, 2022, i started to create the first external server for the version of MineKhan, which was called 'Test server'. (https://replit.com/@MineKhan/mkServer)
External servers were a way to host a world for the version of MineKhan where the world stayed open almost all the time and the world could be controlled with code.
At first, this external server did not have a world, instead, when joining, it asked for a suggestion for the name.
Then, on April 18, a world save code was added, and on April 19, portals (teleports to another room) were added.
The code for external servers was still bad and it was easy to cheat. (flying, getting any item)
New users in April 2022: shubbleYT, eaglemaster (other usernames: Eaglemasterussr), Fire_Fox, sadlyitsnotme, AXL_SENSEI
<details>One time in April 11, I was in a world hosted by someone, it was normal world type. I built a floor on a tree with stairs. But then, it got very slow. I thought that it was anoying, so i changed the code to make it send positions slower to prevent it from getting slow.</details>

On May 3 2022, whitelist was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
Capes and cloud saves for MineKhan were also added.
<details><summary>mysterious hacks</summary>A user who's username was yiff, and also had a previous username that probably contained 'piano' in it, probably appeared on May 5. This user used something that was called 'karmaclient', which was like a bot, to run commands in the version of MineKhan like '.troll username' or '.crash'. Most of the time when he joined, something like these would show: "yiff joined. yiff joined. yiff: [ADMIN] K4RMACLIENT ACTIVATED.". I was in a survival world with normal world type hosted by someone, and he joined with his previous username which contained "piano". He used a command (probably ".kill") when i was in the entrance of a cave, but it did not work because of a bug. Later, I was in a world called "Galdor's castle 2" which had a castle, then he joined with the username that started with a y, and used the command ".crash". A message appeared that said "CR4SH" and it froze. Another time, I was in a superflat world in multiplayer, then he joined but did not turn on the client that had the commands. I used a command like "/sendeval yiff Messages.write('.troll yiff')", then he said something like "you try to use sendeval on me". Unfortunately, this user disappeared after a few days and i did not find other information.</details>

Some time from May to December, i was in a world hosted by someone. It was superflat and i was in underground building. It was around 50 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall. I built a ladder surrounded by probably deepslate bricks that went to the surface, and changed the ceiling to grass slabs. Later, other people were chatting, then someone said something that was black and someone else said "??? minekhan hide your message".
On December 17 2021, there was post called "Join Astrovom" but i didn't see any world hosted by them. One time around May, there was a world hosted by Astrovom, so i joined it. It was normal world type, and there were some buildings floating around 30 blocks above the ground. The world closed soon.
One time, i was in a world with ThrustBacon's castle. I replaced the jungle leaves with flowering jungle leaves.
Another time, i was in a world called "Galdor's castle 2". It was night and I put some beds near a wall and a tree. Later some people used the beds.
Another time around this time, i was in a world hosted by SpaceSoldier. It was normal world type and had a big underground building in a hill, a big underground building with a long hall with automatic lights that went to the surface, and more. I went to the beginning of the hall and pressed a button, and the lights turned on from this side to the other side. It started glitching and turned on and off repeatedly and quickly.
Another time (might be same as above), I was in a world, at a small white building with four pillars and a roof. Then TomMustBe12 joined using a username like "Willard2010".
Another time around this, I was in a survival world with normal world type hosted by someone. I had gotten diamonds and duplicated them and made diamonds blocks. I was probably on a wooden platform with crafting table on some trees, and i placed the diamonds blocks. More details lost.
One time, I was in a world that was normal world type. Other people were there, and I was probably on a tree. The messages were like: ... "???: i can't close the chat" "2-people: press enter" ...

Unfortunately, the popularity decreased a lot in the summer, but multiplayer worlds in the version of MineKhan was still common.
In June 2022, multiplayer in the version of MineKhan stopped working.
The server for the website for MineKhan ran out of space, which happened faster than normal, and stopped working.
This caused multiplayer to stop working.
At this time, i was away for about a week and did not know about it, and some people thought he couldn't fix it.
There was a post called 'Admin vote'.
On June 19, a skybox was added to the version of MineKhan.
It was a simple gradient that was brighter in the middle.
On June 25, the code for external servers were moved. (to https://www.npmjs.com/package/minekhan-server)
On June 27, a room with creative mode was added to the Test server.
A external server called 'War SMP' was also created.
On June 28, a lobby was added, then bedwars was added, which had 4 islands and a wait for 4 players and a win when a bed was broken. It was not very good quality because there was flat layer of grass underneath.

One time, i was in a superflat world made by goatedkiller, called "now playing(minecraft life) (sonic the hedgehog)". There was a theatre with a house on the screen that extended behind, and a building made of gold blocks. The building made of planks had fire on it. I watched it spread.
One time, I joined a world hosted by Speedy4. It was normal world type and survival. It had a tree house on a big jungle tree with stairs (about 30 blocks tall) that came down to the ground. I walked around. Another time in this world, i decided to do a prank. I put water on top of the tree house and a piston that would start and stop the water flow. The first few times of testing it, the water went out of the tree house and flooded the ground and broke many plants. Then, it was fixed and the water only went onto the wheat in the tree house. In this world, I also placed a oak chair at the outside of the treehouse. Another time in this world, Spammer17 joined and i used spectate player. He moved around on the ground. Then, Spammer17 said "stop spectating me". One time, Speedy4 probably asked me if I could make him admin, and I did.
Another time, I was in a world hosted by Speedy4 (might be the same world). It was normal world type and survival. I went to a lake in the 'field' biome, i made some water flow in small canals. Then, i might have made a small waterfall (about 3 blocks tall) in the middle of the water flows. Then i probably added vines. Later someone probably joined and walked around the water flows.
Another time, I joined a different world hosted by Speedy4. It was normal world type and survival. I went to a nearby jungle and got some vines. Then i found a cave near the spawn point. I made a undergounrd house near the opening of the cave. Then i put many vines around the path from the cave opening to the house. Then, i put many more things inside the house.<br><img src="/minekhan/assets/images/panorama/8-12-2022.png" loading="lazy"><br> There was a room that had grass and flowers. I decided to make a hole to the surface above that room. But water came down from the hole and broke the flowers. So i stopped the water (probably with vines) and put the flowers back. Later, i said something like "can i put a picture of this world on the main menu background" and he said something like "ok". After a few days, he became inactive I did not see him again.
One time, i decided to open something like "server.thingmaker.repl.co/findSimilarUsers/???" to see which people where the same. I was surprised to see the result. I changed the username to "sup6666" and it still showed it. It showed that the similar users were Spammer17, netherBuilder, destiny6, MyHat3, Brenda_Puckle. I realized that, in 2021, netherBuilder knew how to fix floating branches because he was probably the same person as sup6666.
One time around this, I was probably in War SMP and found a giant crater. It looked like it came from ultra tnt. I jumped down around it, and stayed for a while.
</details>

In July 2022, there were many accounts on the server that were unused, so many of these were deleted.
On July 6, a external server called 'Dope SMP' was created, and a thing that ban people when they try to ban.
On July 27, flowing water and lava was added to the version of MineKhan.
The flowing water was glitchy in multiplayer because they appeared and disappeared.
On the last day of July, the users and posts and other things were moved again. (level db to cloud storage)
<details>
Another time near this time, I joined a world, normal world type, that had a lot of snow in it. The chunk borders were visible because of the different amounts of snow. There may have been a large tall building. I may have built a large bridge in the world. Some time near this, someone called Coffee suggested to add wolves and snow.
On July 4 2022, the first post about Eaglercraft appeared. It was the first time i saw the name, so i opened the link and found it.
One time near this, I was in a superflat world hosted by someone. RedMonster12 joined. They had joined after a long time (a few months) of inactivity. I wanted to show the flowing water, so i put water on the ground. After a while, RedMonster saw it and said "the water is flowing!". After another while, RedMonster was inactive and probably left.
After July 25, 2022, after I added the spectate player feature, I joined the war smp to test it. The people already there were probably Briannastar, Alicia_Heart, and Clown_Pierce. I tried spectating one of them. It was moving in a irritating way. There were a few rooms inside a hill, and one had pink wool.
Another time, I was in a world probably hosted by Alicia_Heart. It was superflat. There were some buildings. One of them said something like "you can't ban 2-people or you will be banned for 7 days".
One time, I was in a superflat world probably hosted by Kiro_sama, that probably had a large house. There were 2 other people. One person started chasing the other. They were flying and running. The person that was chasing was trying to spectate player. The other person didn't want him to be inside. They said it in the chat. I thought "there is a command called spectatePlayer so you don't need to chase".

August 2022:
On August 1, an external server called "Luke's Server" was created, which had a survival anarchy and a game called 'The Pit' where players fight and get to the top of a tower.
On August 8, claiming chunks was added to the Test server.
There were more external servers: one by Paragram (forgot name), Epixel, one by RedMonster12.

During August and September, more redstone things were added to the version of MineKhan.
<details>
Near this time, someone sent a notification that looked like "New comment at New block thread&lt;/a>". It seemed like it was formatted wrong, so i looked at the unformmated one. It looked like there was XSS code for commenting the cookies in the notification. The post that it commented at was probably by sup6666. I didn't see any comments, so i thought that the XSS was harmless. Later, there probably was a comment by Luke in the post which contained the cookies.
Another time, after i came home, i joined Test Server. Then i saw that someone else had my username. The other people were probably Speedy4 and another one. The messages were like this: <blockquote>2-people: why is there 2 of me<br> 2-people: what did the other one do<br> Speedy4?: not much</blockquote> I quickly typed a command like: "/sendeval 2-people Messages.write(document.cookie)" and probably another that reloaded. Then i quickly deleted the session.
</details>
On August 23, someone (from before) found that Luke's bio said that his account was taken for <span>rans</span>om because he was helping to prevent XSS.
August 2022, new users: gouling, Raeshawna, Paragram, I

In September 2022, TomMustBe12 started sending emails to thingmaker about making him admin or hacking the version of MineKhan.
September 2022, new users: Thunder_Wolf, perX, Express
On September 7, posts were made to load faster.
On September 20, the message was added to the server that showed if someone was a admin when they joined a world in the version of MineKhan.
On September 22, a option for disabling filter for chat was added to the version of MineKhan and the server.
<img src="/assets/images/Screen Shot 2022-09-02 at 8.31.12 PM.jpg" loading="lazy">
<details>Some time before September 19, sup6666 started using the code that disabled the filter for everyone. <code inline>Messages.remove=[]</code> Some time before September 22, sup6666 started saying #saveminecraft. He also sent messages (message: "f___ 2-people") with the title command that had f words that the filter could not remove. He stopped after the option for disabling the filter was added. He probably did it because a filter was added to MC that many people disliked.<br></details>
<details>From August 31 to September 2, thingmaker made a vc for fun (https://replit.com/@thingMaker/voice-chat). It was bad quality but also had a written chat. Soon, many people started using it.</details>
<details>
One time, probably before september 20, I was in a world hosted by someone, with normal world type. There was a house on a hill and a decorated wide tunnel at the bottom of the hill, the hill was a small one. There was also more things. Then, javalover21 joined and started saying something like '2-people is s__t', and may have spammed it. The world closed soon, but the what they said was recorded.Near this time, either Spammer17 or sup6666 started complaining that windows was bad. One time, I was in a world, hosted by someone, that was normal world type and in survival mode, then he joined and i tried to see what he was doing by walking around while staying away. There was a house made of only planks, which i looked at. He was not moving much and occasionaly moved. The messages were something like this: <blockquote>s??: @2-people what operating system are you using?<br>2-people: idk<br>s??: how do you not know?<br>s??: is it windows, mac, or linux?<br>2-people: are you trying to hack<br>s??: no</blockquote> After that, the multiplayer started to get slow, and i told him 'macos monterey'. After a while, he did not respond and the world was closed.One time, i made a new music. I made it a menu music. Later, i was in a superflat world hosted by someone. There was a small house, probably made out of white and red concrete. I said "there is new menu music". After a while, someone said something like "it hurts my ears".
Some time near this, Raeshawna hosted a server called "Raeshawna's survival server", which was a survival server. At the spawn, there was a tree (or/and house) with a chest outside and a sign that sayed that the things in the chest were free. So I did a prank. I made a room under the tree and put a line of hoppers that moved things from the chest to another chest in the room. A while later, I decided to make it move the things to the chest outside. Then, i made a hole with lava inside so that when someone fell in and dropped their items, the items would go to the chest outside. No one really fell in.
One time near this, i was in a world that was normal world type and survival. There was also Raeshawna and probably Haru. There was a building made of oak planks that was around 20 blocks tall and wide. I was doing something else and occasionaly checked the chat messages. Later, i walked away from the house and toward the other people. The messages were like this: <blockquote>Raeshawna: 2-people was here the whole time?<br> ???: ??? 2-people listening to us talk about ???</blockquote>
One time around this, i was in a superflat world hosted by someone. There were a few big statues of people, about 30 blocks tall. I put water in the air in front of the statues and used a command something like: "/sendeval @A tickSpeed=0". The water spread down almost instantly. I might have also put water on the ground.
One time around this, i was in a world that had a big building with many rooms. It was floating a few blocks above the ground. I was in the main room which connected to many other rooms around it. I decided to use a command to get fake planks, which looked like oak stairs but not solid. I put it in the floor near a wall and walked onto it, then i fell through it. Later, i might have replaced the whole floor with fake planks.
One time around this, I joined a world hosted by someone that was island world type. There were no buildings. I put fire on a tree near the bottom of the island, and thought that it won't cause much damage because the trees were generated. I might have also put lava and water on some trees. Later, someone related to the person hosting probably joined. Later, the messages were like: <blockquote>??? tried to ban 2-people<br>2-people: you broke a rule<br>???<br>2-people: rule 3: If your server is not whitlisted, anybody is allowed to join. Do not ban without reason.<br>???: you ??? my world</blockquote> The world probably closed soon. Later, there was another world hosted by the related person, so i joined. It was superflat and the messages were like: <blockquote>???: you ??? my brother's world<br>2-people: im sorry that i ??? world<br>???: i don't ??? you</blockquote> The world probably closed soon.
One time around this, i was in a world hosted by someone in normal world type. I went to a lake that was in a desert and got an idea. I wrote a command that made water flammable and put one block of fire on the water using /filltoplayer.
One time around this, I joined a world maybe called "show and tell" and was normal world type. There was a stage with small hill behind and maybe a sign in front of it. Some people may have said things.

October 2022:
On October 2, comments were added to user profiles.
Later in October, i decided to combine the website and the server with the new website for MineKhan. (https://replit.com/@minekhan/MineKhan)
The maps and wiki pages were also moved to the place where the users and posts were.
The home page of thingmaker's website and the website for MineKhan were also combined, and the website was renamed.
This was also when TomMustBe12 created the form, 'Admin for MineKhan'. (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19w9xtnu1rh1NEWQsQ4LErVo2DCyAbUx_I6bO2AmocgE)
<details>Another thing that happened was that Spa<span>mmer17 sayed that they would make the website g</span>one if not give admin. Many things including code and important history were deleted because of this on GH.</details>
<details>Around this time, many people wanted admin which was probably because they saw that others were. They probably saw being admin as being better. Many people asked thingmaker for it. Most people stopped asking around Janurary 2023.</details>
<details>
One time near October 5, I was in a superflat world hosted by someone. There was also Am_Butter in the world. I put a few cows around. Am_Butter said something like "the cows don't have heads". Later, someone made a big sphere (about 100 blocks wide) but it stopped generating and there was only the bottom part of the sphere. I put a few cows in the sphere (probably from above).Another time, probably in the same world, there was a small house. Someone (possibly me) put some pigs (old version) near the house.Another time near this, I joined a world. It was normal world type and survival mode. There was around 5 houses around, some made of planks. I walked around and looked at some houses. Later, the messages were like this: <blockquote>Am_Butter: why am i not admin anymore?<br> 2-people: you said bad words</blockquote>
Another time around this, I was in a survival world hosted by someone. I probably built a house out of planks in a hill in a desert. When rejoining, the house had sand inside even though i removed it. I got things like pickaxes and cobblestone. Later, i made a portal and went in. The messages were like this: <blockquote>2-people eaned the achievment: Into the nether<br> 2-people tried to swim in lava<br> ???: that's why you don't go to nether</blockquote> I didn't want the items to be deleted, so i changed it to creative mode and went in the portal and got the items back.
Another time near this, I was in a world with normal world type and survival mode. The other people were probably Am_Butter, Raeshawna. They were chatting. I walked around and found 5 trees with the logs next to each other. I said "i found a quintuple tree", but they probably didn't notice it.
Another time around this, I was in a survival world with normal world type hosted by someone. I built a house out of saplings and had placed a trail of torches that went into a desert and went to a cave. Many things happened in the world.
Another time around this, possibly in the same world, i had a idea. i made a tunnel going from the sapling house to a underground house. I made and duplicated some hoppers. Then i put a water stream and hoppers that went from the chest in the other house to the sapling house.
One time, i was in a superflat world hosted by someone. There was a big glass dome with a small house inside. There might have been more spheres. I put some 10 block wide magma block spheres in the sky and put lava on them. The messages were like: "Jake?: 2-people, please give me admin ???" "Am_Butter?: ??? he's manipulating you" "..." I left the world and looked at the chat messages in the log. They were still talking. Jake? said something that proved that he was manipulating. Then i rejoined the world.
One time around this, I was in a world with normal world type. The messages were something like this: "Am_Butter: 2-people, do you want to join ??? world" "2-people: no" "Am_Butter: do you not like me anymore" After i saw that, i was surprised because i simply did not want to join that world. 
One time around this, I was in a superflat world and Am_Butter and some other people were probably there. There was a stage (about 20 by 20 by 10 blocks) that maybe had black and light blue concrete. They were talking. I decided to go behind and do something. I put redstone dust vertically to the underneath of the stage. I probably put something underneath. They didn't seem to notice for the rest of the time.
One time near October 29, I was in a superflat world with many buildings. springyeet was probably there. There was an array of animals made of blocks about 3 by 5 blocks, like cow and frog, probably made by Am_Butter. Later, i copied the cow using copyToPlayer and put one about 50 blocks above ground. I put many more that were overlapping. Then, i connected the gaps to make stairs and halls. It took a while, and i did not want to lose it, so i copied the whole thing and left and created a new world and pasted it. I built some more stuff in it.
One time near October 30, TomMustBe12 found the passwords and edited a few wiki pages. He seemed to target the wiki pages created by Eaglemaster. Eaglemaster said something like "help TomMustBe12 hacked into my account and found all my passwords". Later, i figured out how TomMustBe12 found the passwords. It was in html source, so i fixed it by making the server remove the password from the html source. Later, TomMustBe12 said something like "Where is the password for the wiki stored now?"
</details>

After some time, in November 2022, saving previous version of wiki pages was added to the website for MineKhan.
New users: rayLee
On November 27, a game mode called 'chaos' was added to the Test server. It was a game mode where lava falls from the sky.
At the end of November, external servers for MineKhan were updated to be faster by making it connect directly. (it was like that when external servers were first added)
<details>
One time near this, i joined a world (might be hosted by Luc or Ana). It was normal world type and survival mode. I made a small house out of oak planks next to a ravine. I repeatedly dropped items and duplicated them in the house.
One time near this, I joined a world hosted by either Luc or Ana. It was normal world type and survival. I found a cave with a unusual large opening. I walked around the opening.
<b>mysterious hacks</b>. Another time around this, I joined a superflat world with a few people. There was a house with a few rooms. I was in survival mode and walked around in the house, then i went back out. Then strange things happened. There were some messages from someone that was not in the world. I checked the list of people in the world and the list of people on the main server, but did not find anything unusual. The were messages of them joining but it was wrong (".. has joined" instead of ".. joined"). They said many things and there was a message showing that they left, even though they didn't actually leave. After a while of more messages from them, there was this message: .. " left. (for real this time)".

<datails><summary>Another 'hacked' client</summary>On December 4, TomMustBe12 created something like a plugin that allowed people to cheat. (https://replit.com/@awhatcott/KhaHack) It seemed that only a few people used it.</datails>

One time, I joined Dope SMP and probably TomMustBe12 was there. There was a large dirt half sphere (about 100 by 100) about 20 blocks above the ground. The other person said that they read all of minekhan code.
One time, I joined WAR SMP and saw obsidian floating roads (about 20 blocks above ground) and obsidian messages. I went on the floating obsidian road and followed it for about 50 blocks. I saw a big obsidian message above the road that said "Typing10". I thought that typing10 must have used hacks to do it.
Some time near this, there was a world called 'truthordare' hosted by someone (probably Thunder_Wolf). It was superflat and there was a small building in it. There were a few people there. One time I was in the world and i did a prank. I filled the underneath of the house with piston and redstone, then i turned it on. The floor went up, then went down. Later i connected it to a pressure plate at the door. A few people turned it on and made the floor go up and down.
One time around this, I was in a superflat world hosted by someone. There were some buildings and a lot of autumn leaves on the buildings. TomMustBe12 was in the world and said something like "what is the link to ???". Later, i put a link (thewindow.thingmaker.repl.co) to something that showed a rickroll that can be moved around. TomMustBe12 probably thought that it was the link he asked for and said "Thank you". Later, he probably found out what it was and said something.
One time during winter break, i joined a world with normal world type. There were probably 2 other people. They talked about how they were playing on their computer at schol. I said "there's no scho_l for me"

Janurary 2023, new users: Caterpillar_fan, Light_FN, 2bHNSTi (possibly wrong time)
On Janurary 1, i thought that TomMustBe12 had stlen programs and code from him, so a message was added that explained it.
On Janurary 5, a cape was limited to certain people.
On Janurary 7, the message that showed if someone was a admin was removed.
<details>
Near Janurary 1, i made a world called '2023' because it was a new year. I made a panorama of that. Then, i enabled multiplayer. After a while, DarkWolf joined and made a message appear that seemed to come from me. I found out that it was done by kill command and used it to make this appear: 'DarkWolf: me stpid'. Then DarkWolf said something like "you found the hack".Another time near this, I was in a world that was normal world type. I was at the snowy place. TomMustBe12 was also in the world and he used the sendeval command a lot. I opened devtools to watch what he was doing. I walked around the snowy place.
One time around this, i was looking at things on TomMustBe12 profile on replit. I saw some comments like this: "??? | why did you stop developing KhaHack?" "TomMustBe12 | replit and thingmaker told me to stop because it was hacking another person's project"
</details>

Feburary 2023
<details>rayLee sayed that they would <span>take away the website and b<span>an thing</span>maker from the website if not gi</span>ven admin.</details>
On Feburary 3, features.js was added to the version of MineKhan.
It was a script that had a 1 in 1000 chance of running, that would randomly show the message 'it will be gone' and run randomly generated commands.

As March 2023 began, the website was about to be moved again because the website started to stop working and replit's free hosting was going to end in 2024.
The console of the server was filled messages of socket hang up or something similar.
At this time, resource packs had also been added to the version of MineKhan.
Finally, after a month, the website was moved. (to thingmaker.us.eu.org)
TNJS did not go to the new website.

<h3>Quiet age starts</h3>
After the website was moved, the website started working again and became faster.
The website was renamed back to 'My website'.
At this time, the website popularity had decreased more.
In April 2023, many things were added to the version MineKhan, including hardcore mode, double sided signs, debug stick, oil, silver, and more.
Also, i tried adding a ender dragon, and started making a classic resource pack
<details>
On April 6, i made a world called 'something', which had a big image of rickroll made out of blocks. I enabled multiplayer, then Willard21 joined. The message were like this: <blockquote>Willard21: Lol, a rickroll<br>2-people: are you real willard<br>Willard21: Yes, I came on here to how nametags were rendered<br>Willard21: , you can go into blocks on this version.</blockquote> He walked into the image, then out. Then he went on top of the image and sprinted and jumped back and forth.

One time i made a world called 'place to build stuff'. I built a house on a small tree with stairs going to the ground. Some people joined and built stuff. Later DarkWolf joined and this is what the messages were like: <blockquote>DarkWolf: i expect rewardment for dming you <br>2-people: what does dming mean <br>DarkWolf: it means direct message</blockquote> I knew that he could not have sent a direct message, so i though that someone might be imposter. After that, the multiplayer probably disconnected and i did not find out more.

Multiplayer was also changed to make cheating harder.

Many more months were used to improve the terrain in the version of MineKhan because i did not think it was good enough.
