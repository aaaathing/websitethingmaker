LIST GUIDE:

Each item in the main list is called a game position. The game determines what part of the story you are at by shifting you current
position in the array by the amount next to the word you typed. In the example [```Story```, [], 'run', 2, 'hide', 1] typing run would shift
the position in the array that is printed down 2.

The second item in the game position list is where game events happen. A loop iterates over every two items, the first of the two being the
type of event and the second being the value accosiated with the event.

The value of the battle event is another list that has 7 items. These are what each item designates in the battle function:
1: the name of the enemy. 2: the hp of the enemy. 3: the name of the weapon the enemy has. 4: boolean for whether the enemy is in melee range
5: the power of the enemy. 6: boolean for whether the player is in melee range. 7: bolean for whether the player goes first. 8: how far the game
position will switch if you win the battle.

Each desision in the game will alter the game events that will happen, paths you will take, and battles you will win. The way battles begin
can be key in determining who wins the fight.*/

Standing above you is an old man dressed in weeds and flowers, singing a chant. A single dim ray of light enters the tent from a sunrise that has just begun. The cuts and lacerations all over your body make it hard to move, and you feel that you have several broken bones. The old man finishes his incantations. Children reach up from below you, pouring a purple liquid into your wounds. This village elder must be using you to teach the young natives healing magic.

AWAKY!" and the kids run out of the tent screaming. "Its okay, I won't hurt you." You tell the man, but he doesn't seem to understand even with your gentle tone.

It is winter and the leaves are missing, so it shouldn't be too hard to navigate. In the hopes that you can find a town or settlement you enter. As you roam, you try to recollect why you has sustained those injuries. Only a sense of dread occompanies these thoughts, and your mind seems adamant to keep it a secret. Before long, you aproach a road that cuts through the center of the forest. Almost immediatly, raw and extensive horror befalls you. Lining the road are randomly sprawled bodies, all of them pointing in the same direction. You cannot exactly tell how they died, very little skin was left on their skeletons, but you can tell that they were all running from something. A terror so great it maintains even in death is plastered onto the face of one of them. Their arm is outstrechted, clutching the ground as a means to escape whatever pursued them.

Aghast, your urge to [flee] from whatever chased them down this road is almost a means of carrying their last moment with you, sharing the fear even if the danger no longer remains.

You crash into a frozen creek at the bottom. The layer of ice is thin and the water is extreemly cold. You pull yourself out, freezing.

Once you have reached the top it has become a howling wind, you are freezing from the inside. To your dismay you gaze upon only more trees, stabbing through the fog like dead shrubs. You look up, and see a swirling vortex of clouds. In the center is an eye, where the clouds end abruptly, and it is not far from where you are. You begin to hear a rumbling, it is deep and guttural and sounds like it was coming from every direction. The wind is picking up, becoming violent, and threatening to throw you from the tree. You clutch the branches as tight as you can. The eye of the vortex is nearing. The tree is bending under the force of the wind which almost seems to scream. Suddenly everything is quiet. The wind is still. The tree creaking from the stress is the only remaining sound. Everything is dark, sort of dreamy. You look down and see a cloaked figure, holding out a hand to you while the other grips a scythe. You stare, petrified. The longer you stare, the closer he seems to you. You can look at nothing but it's hand. It is like nothing you have seen before, comprised of pure wonder. You gaze into the center of it's palm and observe the summation of entire lives. You see happiness, regret, redemption, and love. The Reaper shuts its hand with a snap, it is now inches from your face. Reality sinks in, you are floating in the air over it's claw. You scream in rage and twirl in the air trying to attack the enitity. You grab onto a tree and pull yourself away right before he swings his scythe.

  `At last, peace. But the satisfaction of your victory abruptly ceases. You are still staring at the painting. The painting of the king. Your mind races with questioning. It was real, it surely happened. You did not imagine it, yet the only remanant of the world you had just left was your quickly fading  memory. An error, in the universe. That's what the king had called you. What was his name again? You  look for the plaque of the painting that showed his name, but it was gone. If only, if... Your mind  becomes calm. You stand up. Your back is oddly sore. You are suprised to see that it is no longer  daylight out, and everyone has left the museum. How had it gotten so late? Before exiting the room,  you ponder at the painting that was in front of you. Why had the museum put up a blank painting?  Fortunately, this only intrigues you momentarily and you leave without a second thought.`,

`The first parking space you find is a mile from the museum. It had just opened a new exhibit that  claimed to showcase artifacts found in a church buried by volcanic ash 700 years ago. It had attracted  the attention of countless people and it was sure to be packed. You never cared for museums but this  sounded especially intresting to you. Once you arrive you see that it is packed with visitors. Perhaps  the second day of opening would have been a wiser time to come, but you simply couldn't wait to see.  You enter, squeezing by everyone around you. There are small metal plaques protruding from the ground  that give information about each item. You read each one with scrutiny, paying attention to every  detail. It was amazing that an entire building could remain undiscovered for so long. You make your way  around the long hall that makes up the exhibit. They were even able to recover human remains! After an  hour, you finally reach the end of the hall. A massive perfectly preserved painting sits in the center  of the wall, and a small red couch faces it. You find it odd that no other guests are looking at the  painting. You take a seat, taking in the entire painting. The painting depicts a magnificient king, yet  he seems oddly troubled. You look at the plaque. There are only three words written on it: "The king `
+ atob(Kname) + `." You look deep into the kings eyes and see, longing, fear, and regret. Why was a king as powerful as him  so deeply disturbed? Suddenly, you hear a loud ripping sound. You feel everything being torn apart. The  building, everyone in it, all shredded into nothing. You are nowhere. You feel a force of incredible  strength begin to pull you apart. Your skin and bones start to rip. Darkness takes hold of your mind.`
