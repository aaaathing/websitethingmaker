<center><h1 class="font">Future updates for the minekhan website!</h1>
<p class="font">So, from the moment we first launched the official Minekhan website, we had only a 1 idea in mind: a place for users to find, and share maps. We set off creating a simple website, that allowed a forum-like sharing database for minekhan maps. After finishing the basic site, we thought "Hey! We should make a wiki!" And so, we began work on that. Now we are aware that the colors, and styling for the wiki are a  . . Uh. . . How should is say this? <b>Terrible.</b> So, in the coming future, this is the update log that is planned, and what we are thinking about adding! If you want to let us know of any other ideas, leave a comment below, and we will be sure to check it out!</p>

  <p class="font"><b></Coming>Coming updates:
  <br></b>
 <b><i> Wiki site update:
 </i></b><br>
    - We plan to update the wiki home, and pages. If all goes according to plan, TNJS will change formatting and coloring of the wiki page, to look more professional, and functional. Updates should be finished by 1/20/22
  <br>
    <br>
<b><i>Home page update:</i></b>
  <br>
  The home page should be updated, to be more appealing, and have fewer buttons. Updates should be finished by 1/20/22<br><br>
</p>

  <p class="font"><i><b>Well, that is all we have so far, so give us more ideas in the comments below!</b></i></p>
